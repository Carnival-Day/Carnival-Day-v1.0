  - Get over here kid, you're the new worker right? Thought so.
  - We don't have much time before the carnival opens so let me give you a quick
    run down. So listen up.
  - Next to me is where you will need to access upgrades for the carnival. You need
    money for that.
  - Since I'm feeling so generous, here's 600 for the first one.
  - 'Other than that, there''s the controls, W, A, S, D is to walk and C is to crouch. '
  - J is for your tasks and M is for the map.
